## Introduction

The `information_retrieval_ensemble` project combines two different indexing methods to create an efficient and accurate information retrieval system. The ensemble method improves the search results by aggregating the strengths of each individual indexing system.

## Features

- Ensemble method combining two indexing systems.
- Enhanced search accuracy and efficiency.
- Easy-to-use interface for searching and retrieving information.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/information_retrieval_ensemble.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd information_retrieval_ensemble
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
2. Open `main.ipynb` in your Jupyter Notebook interface.
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to use the ensemble information retrieval system.
